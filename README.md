# BudgetingApp

Budget App is to help you manage your money.  At the beginning of every month, you make sure every dollar is accounted for.  
Many people say they would like the ability to “look under the hood” of their finances and get more visibility into their actual spending. 
Everything in this application is built around giving your money a job.   You can easily customize your budget to fit your needs, 
and even though you’re giving every dollar a job at the beginning of the month, you can edit your budget at any time if an unexpected 
cost comes up.   If you’re ready to account where every cent of your money goes, than this budgeting app could work for you. . .  
It could help you be more financially proactive.  Having a budget really helps you stay disciplined to organize your finances, which is the 
first step of knowing your overall financial health.  Without easy to read data, there is no way of knowing what is going on.  By keeping 
track of your budget you will know exactly how much money you actually need on a monthly basis.  This budget app will help you to know your 
exact financial situation and will help lift a tremendous amount of stress off your shoulders.  


### Things left to do:

•	Have a total amount for all of my categories at the top, perhaps in the app bar/toolbar so that the user can know their total budget 
for the month at all times.  

•	Also have the month displayed somewhere that the current budget is for, not just in the transactions page but on the front page. 

•	Add a toast for when user deletes transaction, confirming that they really want to delete it.  

•	Have an “add category” button so user has the option to create their own category if what they are looking for is not listed in my 
category list.
