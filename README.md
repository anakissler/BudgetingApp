# Budget App
I chose to develop a budgeting app to help myself and others manage money.  At the beginning of every month, you make sure every dollar is accounted for.  Many people say they would like the ability to “look under the hood” of their finances and get more visibility into their actual spending.  Everything in this app is built around giving your money a job.   You can easily customize your budget to fit your needs, and even though you’re giving every dollar a job at the beginning of the month, you can edit your budget at any time if an unexpected cost comes up.   If you’re ready to account where every cent of your money goes, than this budgeting app could work for you. . .  It could help you be more financially proactive.  Having a budget really helps you stay disciplined to organize your finances, which is the first step of knowing your overall financial health.  Without easy to read data, there is no way of knowing what is going on.  By keeping track of your budget you will know exactly how much money you actually need on a monthly basis.  This budget app will help you to know your exact financial situation and will help lift a tremendous amount of stress off your shoulders.  
	This app is fully functioning and ready to use.  It can keep track of your transactions and let you know when you get close to hitting your total budget amount with my progress bars in each category.  I believe in order for this app to be a minimally viable release I would need to implement an API for bank account information for the user.  I believe with this information the user can see updates to their account balance as they track they’re spending.  I think another element that could be added to this app is the ability to sync this information with other users, for instance a family that may want to track every family members spending and include it all into one budget.  
 
 ### This version of my app has been tested on:
•	Nexus 5x API 22(Android 5.1.1, API 22)

### Cosmetic improvements:
1.	 The layout of my transactions list could use improvement.  I would outline each transaction with all of its contents in a border to distinguish one from the other.  
2.	 Changing the font so that it is consistent throughout the whole app would make it look a lot better.

### Stretch Goals

1.	A graph to show you where you are spending the most could be a useful element in this app. 
2.	Adding alerts with sound for when you get close to hitting your budget max would benefit this app overall. 
3.	My app has the budget amount set for each category, I think adding how much you have spent (in numbers) out of that budget for each category would have its advantages.  Not only the overall amount you have spent out of your total budget but the amount you have spent out of each categories budget.
